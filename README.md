# TODO
• Fix display of ship name

• Save last location of your ship in User Defaults so if you leave the game and come back you don't keep starting near Earth.

• Work on Moon view

• Explore Mars

• Add icons on go to selection screen

• Speed up travel video segue

# Multiple Universes
• If someone is interested in forking this code and creating their own universe, we could link the universes together through a worm hole kind of like a web ring. Contact me at andy@greenrobot.com to get started.
