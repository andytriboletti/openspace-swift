# TODO
• Allow ship name, color, and design selection.

• Complete 7 wonders of the World screen by selecting images of the wonders at Pexels, and coding them to show up correctly.

• Save last location of your ship in User Defaults so if you leave the game and come back you don't keep starting near Earth.

• Add more views of Earth to the Space Station.

• Work on Moon view

# Multiple Universes
• If someone is interested in forking this code and creating their own universe, we could link the universes together through a worm hole kind of like a web ring. Contact me at andy@greenrobot.com to get started.
